<h4>What is it?</h3>

<p>A framework for writing PHP web applications that follows sane
programming conventions and generally stays out of your way.</p>

<p>Nife provides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Action/view separation via Response objects.</li>
<li>Utilities for solving common problems correctly and succinctly.</li>
<li>A convention for structuring your project, compatible with <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Does it do MVC?</h4>

<p>Nife doesn't force you to follow any specific design pattern, but
it's designed to help you build systems with an MVC-ish architecture.</p>

<h4>What differentiates it from other MVC frameworks?</h4>

<p>Nife doesn't shove its own way of doing things down your throat and
doesn't bloat your project with useless code.  For example, Nife
doesn't include its own router/dispatcher mechanism because I've never
seen a PHP routing library that was anything more than a verbose,
inflexible pseudo-DSL to write if/else chains (and possibly a reverse
lookup mechanism which nobody consistently uses, anyway).  With Nife,
you just write your if/else chain.</p>

<p>Nife is a 'framework' in a truer sense of the word.  It provides
conventions to follow and a few, well-defined interfaces and utility
classes to help you follow them.</p>

<h4>Is it compatible with <em>X</em>?</h4>

<p>Yes.  Nife is a <em>plain old object-oriented PHP library</em>,
which means you can mix it with whatever other libraries and your own
code you see fit.</p>

<!-- This shouldn't need to be listed as a feature, but enough other
PHP frameworks go out of their way to force you to write the rest of
your code all weird that I decided it was worth mentioning.  -->

<h4>Is it efficient?</h4>

<p>If your web site/application is more than one page and is doing a
few require_onces already, Nife adds very little additional overhead.</p>

<!-- And if not, you don't need a framework! -->

<p>Nife's classes are designed to avoid doing unnecessary computations
or waits, so in some cases may provide a performance improvement over
fully-procedural PHP.</p>

<h4>Why "Nife"?</h4>

<p>This name follows a long tradition of naming frameworks after
misspelled pieces of equipment and/or fish.</p>
